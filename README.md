<h1>Smart Stick For blind people IOT Project</h1>
<br>
<ul>This is IOT Project - SMART STICK FOR BLIND PEOPLE </ul>
<br>
<ul>In this project,The smart stick uses ultrasonic sensors to detect objects within a certain range (typically 2cm to 400cm). The sensor sends out sound waves and measures the time it takes for the echo to return. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the Arduino processes the data and activates a alert the user.
